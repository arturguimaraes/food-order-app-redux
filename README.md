## Introduction

This is a ReactJS, Redux, Typescript and Sass project. This simulates a food ordering app, with cart items control for a basic e-commerce shop.

1. Redux (Hooks, Store, Actions, Slice, State, Dispatch)
2. useState, useEffect
3. Interface
4. Event handlers
5. Sass modules
6. Spread operators

## Features

The Food Order App Redux includes the following features:

1. Cart control for adding correctly amounts if item is already in cart.
2. If item not in cart, add to it normally.
3. Item removal in case of subtracting less than 1 amount, or subtracts amount.
4. Empty cart feature.
5. All features above are controlled via Redux dispatch actions.
